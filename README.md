# SocialMob-app

This is a small version of social app that contains 3 screens:
- Splash screen
- Home screen
- Post details screen

__App features:__

- The user can view a list of posts with the number of comments in the home screen
- The user can click on one post to view its details and the comments on that post

__Notes:__

- The used image in the splash screen was found on trnet with the same name :)
- The posts, user, and coments object returned from the API calls did npt contain an image for the users so a placeholder image was used
